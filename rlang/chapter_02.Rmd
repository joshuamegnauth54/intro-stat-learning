# Chapter 2 solutions
## (code only)

Chapter 2's lab is an introduction to R. Do I really want to go through those exercises? Nope!

See the Python version for explanations. I'm just porting the code over to R.

### Question 7
```{r question_7}
library(tidyverse)

# A tibble of the data from question 7.
colors_df <- tibble(X1 = c(0, 2, 0, 0, -1, 1),
                    X2 = c(3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1),
                    X3 = c(0, 0, 3, 2, 1, 1),
                    Y = c("Red", "Red", "Red", "Green", "Green", "Red"))

distances_df <-
  colors_df %>%
  select(X1, X2, X3) %>%
  mutate(X1 = (X1 - 0)^2,
         X2 = (X2 - 0)^2,
         X3 = (X3 - 0)^2) %>%
  rowSums() %>%
  sqrt() %>%
  bind_cols(colors_df %>% select(Y)) %>%
  rename(distance = `...1`)

distances_df %>%
  arrange(desc(distance)) %>%
  slice_max(distance, n = 3) %>%
  summarize(fct_count(Y, sort = TRUE, prop = TRUE))
```
