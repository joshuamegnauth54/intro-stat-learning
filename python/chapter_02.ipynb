Obviously, looking at a DataFrame and calculating a conditional probability in your head isn't progammatic. We can calculate the probability programatically by filtering for a class, J, to give us an indicator variable where 1 indicates that the nearest neighbor is of class J. Then, the mean of that output is the probability. Here's an example below."
