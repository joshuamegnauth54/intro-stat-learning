# Introduction to Statistical Learning solutions
Solutions to Introduction to Statistical Learning in Python and R.

ISLR is a free and open source text that introduces statistical or machine learning from a theoretical perspective. The text is comprehensive but simpler than _Elements of Statistical Learning._ You may find [ISLR here.](https://statlearning.com/).
I'm working through ISLR in both Python and R. Solutions are provided for both languages in the respective folders.

Note that I'm only providing code solutions, but I've commented and mildly annotated the code where necessary. Other students (and lecturers) have posted solutions to the conceptual questions as well as the labs online, so check those out if you'd like (clearly superior) answers.

I split my solutions into *_lab and *_applied so that following along is easier.
