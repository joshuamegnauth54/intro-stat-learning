# Introduction to Statistical Learning solutions
Solutions to Introduction to Statistical Learning in Python and R.

ISLR is a free and open source text that introduces statistical or machine learning. The text is comprehensive but simpler than _Elements of Statistical Learning._ You may find [ISLR here.](https://statlearning.com/).
I'm working through ISLR in both Python and R. Solutions are provided for both languages in the respective folders.

Note that I'm only providing code solutions, but I've commented and mildly annotated the code where necessary. Solutions to the conceptual portions are easily found online if you would like to check yourself.
